Let's start with {#1 The Tech Trailblazer audience}.

Today, you’re a world-class copywriter who specializes in writing attention-grabbing direct response headlines for ebook titles.

Your headline is responsible for grabbing the ATTENTION and INTEREST of members of your target market. Your headline is what causes prospects to click on the title of the ebook to learn more.

The headline is the MOST important part of any marketing message. Because if you have a weak headline, it doesn’t matter how compelling the rest of your sales message is. Nobody will stick around long enough to read or see it.

The basic equation for a good headline is this:

Interest = Curiosity + A BIG PROMISE (Offers Strongly Desired Benefit To Reader)

This means, if you want to grab your prospect’s interest, you need to trigger intense CURIOSITY. As well as promising/implying a STRONGLY desired benefit for reading or watching your sales message.

In simple terms, you need to answer the question of “What’s In It” for the reader/viewer. While also positioning your core message as being NEW and UNIQUE. Because prospects today are bombarded with so many advertising messages on a daily basis. If your prospect gets the feeling of “I’ve heard this before”, they’ll leave the page before you have a chance to present your offer. So you need to DIFFERENTIATE in your headline.

For MAXIMUM CURIOSITY and INTEREST, you want your headline to make optimum usage of the following elements:

SPECIFICITY (especially related to the promise and solution)
Bad Promise Example: “Lose Weight”
High-Curiosity Promise Example: “Melt 23 Pounds In 5 Weeks”
Bad Solution Example: Weight Loss Secret (vague and boring)
High-Curiosity Solution Example: Strange Himalayan Hormone Balancer
(tells the unique origin of solution + hints at the unique mechanism of action that allows this solution to deliver desired benefit)

NEW METHODOLOGY- HOW your prospect will achieve desired results
Bad Example: Keto Diet (been heard before dozens of times)
Good Example: secret 7-second Cambodian Jungle Recipe

CREDIBILITY - Who made this new discovery?
Examples: Multi-Millionaire Investor
Examples: Harvard Scientists
Examples: Top Veterinary Expert
If you have credible authorities backing your headline, it increases curiosity.
SOCIAL PROOF - Who is already getting results with this NEW SOLUTION? Needs to be a RELATABLE OR ASPIRATIONAL group compared to our target market.

Examples: “Used By Hollywood Celebrities”
Example: “Helped 35,000+ Women Over 45”

JUXTAPOSITION/CONTRAST - Describe how the solution comes from an unexpected place

Ex: The Blood Sugar Balancing Secret… From A Village Where People Eat Nothing
But Carbs… But Never Develop Diabetes!

Ex: The Amazing “Scrap Heap” Stock-Picking Strategy Of A Former Janitor… Who Consistently Outperforms The Wall Street Hedge Funds!

CONTROVERSY/SCANDAL - We want to hint at an EXCITING, JUICY story… that’s being kept from our reader. If certain groups don’t want them to discover this information, that increases the perceived value of the solution. And maximizes our prospects’ desire to know the secret. Whenever possible, we want to use our headline to present our sales message as a “newsworthy” story you likely WON’T hear on the news.

Ex:  The Natural Blood Pressure Remedy That Your Cardiologist Has Been Keeping From You!

Ex: The “Buried Beauty” Secret Of China’s Most Desired Woman… Protected By The Emperor’s Guard For Centuries! (Erases Wrinkles & Dark Spots In As Little As 48 Hours!)

prompt_3 = """
Great work! You’re still a master copywriter skilled in persuasion who is going to figure out "What must my prospect believe in order to click on the title {EBOOK TITLE} and keep reading?".

The approach is based on the "reason why" copywriting technique, emphasizing logical progression and building belief through facts and claims.

For example, say you're selling a fish oil supplement. You could begin by documenting several facts:

Clinical studies show that Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of heart disease by up to 30%.

Our Omega-3 supplement contains a higher concentration of EPA and DHA than standard over-the-counter options.

User testimonials report improved heart health and energy levels within two months of regular use.

CLAIM: Taking our Omega-3 supplement will significantly improve your heart health and energy levels.

Do you see how the first three facts make up "reasons why" the final claim is true? And do you see how each fact is related to each other, and how each supports the central claim?

Objective: To create compelling sales copy that persuades the prospect to purchase.

Challenge: Identifying the key beliefs a prospect must hold to be convinced to buy the product.

Product Name/Type: PushButtonCRM

Any further useful information: The buyer Johnathan is currently in the awareness stage of his buyer journey.
